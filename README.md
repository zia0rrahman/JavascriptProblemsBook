# Javascript Problems

![](.gitbook/assets/jsp.png)

 Hi, My name is **Ziaur Rahman**. I am a Developer and I love to write Code. At this moment I am learning **JavaScript Programming Language** which is the most popular and powerful language now. Now I am facing some cool problems and solving those problems. So, I thought that if I write a book which included these problems it very much useful for JavaScript beginners. These problems can be solved by other programming languages also but at this moment I am using JavaScript. If I do any mistake Please forgive me and I am not an expert. I am just doing it for my fun purpose.
